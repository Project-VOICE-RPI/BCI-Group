# Decoding English Alphabet Letters Using EEG Phase Information

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5808334/

## Summary

EEGs offer information about sensory signals that are being processed. It is possible that individual letters of the alphabet can be parsed from these signals. While it is still a highly volatile field, results may help further BCI performance.

## Discriminating between Characters

Many techniques are currently being applied to try to get a better picture of the data, as results have a lot of interference and can be hard to discriminate.

Techniques include: (TODO Look into Later)

- EEG
- ECoG
- ERP
- SSVEP

The information that contains letters and how they're processed in the brain is linked to multiple different factors relating to the phase patterns and power of oscillations.

### Key Terms

EEG - electroencephalograms
BCI - brain-computer interface
