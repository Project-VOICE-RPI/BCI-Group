5 Types Of Brain Waves Frequencies: Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta - MentalHealthDaily
All five type of brains waves will be displayed but one can be more dominant depending on your state of consciousness 
Gamma waves
Involved in higher processing tasks as well as cognitive functioning 
Important for learning, memory, and information processing.
It has a frequency of 40 Hz (which is important for the binding of our senses in regards to perception and involved in learning new material) to 100 Hz. (highest)
People with learning disabilities and those who are mentally challenged tend to have lower gamma activity on average.
Too much means: Anxiety, high arousal, stress
Too little means: ADHD, depression, and learning disabilities 
Optimal for binding senses, cognition, information processing, learning, perception, and REM sleep 
Meditation increases gamma waves
Beta Waves
High frequency and low amplitude brain waves that are usually observed while the person is awake. 
They are involved in conscious thought, logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect.
Correlated to how concentrated and focused we are.
It has a frequency of 12 Hz to 40 Hz (high)
Too much means: Adrenaline, anxiety, high arousal, inability to relax, stress
Too little mean: ADHD, daydreaming, depression, poor cognition
Optimal for conscious focus, memory, and problem solving
Coffee, energy drinks, and various stimulants increase beta waves
Alpha Waves
This frequency range bridges the gap between our conscious thinking and subconscious mind (between theta and beta).
It helps us calm down and promotes feelings of deep relaxation 
If we become too stressed, “alpha blocking” may occur (excessive beta activity and little alpha activity because the beta waves “block” out the production of alpha waves due to high arousal)
It has a frequency of 8 Hz to 12 Hz (moderate)
Too much means: daydreaming, inability to focus, too relaxed
Too little means: Anxiety, high stress, insomnia, and OCD
It is optimal for relaxation
Alcohol, marijuana, relaxants, and some antidepressants increase alpha waves
Theta Waves
This frequency wave is involved in daydreaming and sleep.
Theta waves are correlated to us feeling deep and intense emotions.
It has a frequency range of 4 Hz to 8 Hz (slow)
Too much means: ADHD, depression, hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattentiveness and being in a “highly suggestible” state (due to being in a deeply relaxed, semi-hypnotic state)
Too little means: Anxiety, poor emotional awareness, stress
It is optimal for creativity, emotional connection, intuition, and relaxation
Depressants increase theta waves
Delta waves
They are most often found in infants and young children. As we age, we tend to produce less delta waves even during sleep.
They correlate to the deepest levels of relaxation and restorative, healing sleep and unconscious bodily functions (e.g. heartbeat and digestion)
Adequate production of delta waves helps us feel completely rejuvenated after we wake up from deep sleep.
It has a frequency range of 0 Hz to 4 Hz (slowest).
Too much means: brain injuries, learning problems, inability to think, and severe ADHD
Too little means: inability to rejuvenate body, inability to revitalize the brain, and poor sleep
It is optimal for the functioning of your immune system, natural healing, and restorative/deep sleep.
