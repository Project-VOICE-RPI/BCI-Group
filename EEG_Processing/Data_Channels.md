(Summarized and explained using chat gpt)

1. Magnetometers (mag)
   What it Measures: Magnetic fields generated by neural activity in the brain.
   Use Case: Often used in Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a non-invasive technique to study brain activity.
   Units: Measured in femtotesla (fT) when scaled by 1e+15 (where 1 fT = 1e-15 teslas).
   Notes: Magnetometers are highly sensitive devices that detect tiny magnetic fields.
2. Gradiometers (grad)
   What it Measures: Differences in magnetic fields between two points.
   Use Case: Also common in MEG. By focusing on differences, they reduce the effect of external magnetic interference.
   Units: Measured in fT/cm (femtotesla per centimeter) when scaled by 1e+13.
   Notes: Gradiometers are often more noise-resistant and can offer clearer signals in environments with magnetic interference.
3. Electroencephalography (EEG, eeg)
   What it Measures: Electrical activity along the scalp generated by brain cells.
   Use Case: Widely used in clinical and research settings to study brain function.
   Units: Scaled to microvolts (µV) by 1e+06, where 1 µV = 1e−6 volts.
   Notes: EEG is a non-invasive method, good for measuring brain wave patterns and detecting abnormal activity, like seizures.
4. Current Source Density (CSD, csd)
   What it Measures: Localized electrical activity, showing how current flows in and out of different brain regions.
   Use Case: Analyzing how electric currents change within specific regions.
   Units: Scaled to millivolts per square meter (mV/m²) by a factor of 1000.
   Notes: CSD can provide high spatial resolution of brain activity compared to traditional EEG.
5. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG, seeg)
   What it Measures: Electrical activity from within the brain, captured by electrodes inserted into the brain tissue.
   Use Case: Often used in surgical planning for epilepsy treatment.
   Units: Scaled to millivolts (mV) by 1000.
   Notes: sEEG is highly invasive but allows researchers to measure activity deep in the brain.
6. Electrocorticography (ECoG, ecog)
   What it Measures: Electrical activity from the surface of the brain, recorded using electrodes placed directly on the cortex.
   Use Case: Used in surgical settings and research to get high-resolution brain signals.
   Units: Scaled to microvolts (µV) by 1e+06.
   Notes: ECoG is less invasive than sEEG but still requires surgery. It provides more detailed data than scalp EEG.
7. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS, dbs)
   What it Measures: Electrical signals in deep brain structures, often in response to electrical stimulation.
   Use Case: Common in treating conditions like Parkinson’s disease.
   Units: Scaled to microvolts (µV) by 1e+06.
   Notes: DBS involves implanted electrodes and can both stimulate and record activity, helping to regulate abnormal brain activity.
8. Oxyhemoglobin (hbo) and Deoxyhemoglobin (hbr)
   What they Measure: Concentrations of oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) blood in the brain.
   Use Case: Reflects blood flow and oxygen use, used in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   Units: Scaled to micromolar (µM) by 1e+06.
   Notes: Changes in oxygen levels provide indirect data on brain activity, since active brain areas require more oxygen.
9. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) Parameters
   fNIRS CW Amplitude (fnirs_cw_amplitude): Continuous Wave (CW) amplitude, reflects blood flow by detecting changes in light absorption.
   Units: Measured in volts (V).
   fNIRS FD AC Amplitude (fnirs_fd_ac_amplitude): Frequency Domain (FD) AC amplitude, related to the concentration of hemoglobin.
   Units: Measured in volts (V).
   fNIRS FD Phase (fnirs_fd_phase): Frequency Domain (FD) phase, indicating the phase shift in light, which correlates with blood oxygenation.
   Units: Measured in radians (rad).
   fNIRS OD (fnirs_od): Optical density (OD), which reflects the absorption of light at different wavelengths to infer hemoglobin concentration.
   Units: Measured in volts (V).
   These measures combined allow for a comprehensive assessment of neural and hemodynamic activity, essential for understanding both electrical brain function and associated blood flow dynamics.
